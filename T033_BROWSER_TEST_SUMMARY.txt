T033: E2E Browser Tests - Student Knowledge Graph
================================================

Status: BLOCKED - Cannot complete testing due to critical authentication failure

Test Execution Summary:
- Tests Run: 16
- Passed: 7 (43.75%)
- Failed: 9 (56.25%)
- Browser: Chromium
- Environment: Development (localhost)

CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES:

1. AUTHENTICATION FAILURE (HTTP 401)
   - /api/profile/student/ returns 401 Unauthorized
   - Session expires or user has no access
   - Blocks all graph functionality testing
   - Error: "Сессия истекла или нет прав доступа"

2. KNOWLEDGE GRAPH PAGE NOT LOADING
   - Page navigates to /dashboard/student/knowledge-graph
   - No title elements found (h1/h2)
   - Likely redirected to auth due to 401 error
   - Cannot verify page structure

3. GRAPH NODES NOT CLICKABLE
   - Lesson nodes found (1 node) but not interactive
   - Click events not triggering navigation
   - Users cannot access lessons from graph

4. MISSING UI ELEMENTS
   - Progress percentage not displaying
   - Lesson status legend not visible
   - Zoom/pan functionality not implemented
   - Tooltips not showing on hover

PASSING TESTS (Partial Validation):

✓ Graph visualization renders (1 node found)
✓ Graph responsive at all sizes (1920x1080, 768x1024, 375x667)
✓ Graph loads in 822ms (excellent performance)
✓ Alert dialog for locked lessons functional
✓ Page state maintained on navigation

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA STATUS:

Verified: 4/13 (31%)
- ✓ Responsive on all viewports
- ✓ Performance acceptable (< 2s load time)
- ✓ Locked lessons show alert
- ✓ Graph visualization renders

Not Verified: 9/13 (69%) - Blocked by auth failure
- ✗ Student can view knowledge graph (auth error)
- ✗ All lessons display as nodes (only 1 found)
- ✗ Dependencies show as edges (cannot verify)
- ✗ Status colors correct (legend not visible)
- ✗ Progress % displays and updates (not visible)
- ✗ Can click unlocked lessons (click not working)
- ✗ Lesson completion unlocks next (not tested)
- ✗ Works for multiple subjects (selector broken)
- ✗ Interactive features work (zoom/pan not implemented)

REQUIRED FIXES (Priority Order):

CRITICAL - MUST FIX FIRST:
1. Fix authentication - Verify test user credentials
2. Fix knowledge graph route - Ensure page loads

HIGH PRIORITY:
3. Implement node click handlers
4. Display progress percentage
5. Show status legend

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
6. Implement zoom/pan
7. Add lesson tooltips
8. Fix test selectors

TEST DATA ISSUES:
- Test user: student@test.com - credentials valid?
- Test graph: Only 1 lesson node found - minimal data?
- No multiple subjects to test subject switching

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
See: /home/mego/Python Projects/THE_BOT_platform/T033_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_E2E_TEST_RESULTS.md

TEST FILE:
frontend/tests/e2e/knowledge-graph/student.spec.ts

NEXT STEPS:
1. Investigate authentication failure with test user
2. Verify knowledge graph route exists and loads
3. Create subtasks for missing functionality
4. Re-run tests after critical fixes

Estimated Time to Fix: 3-4 hours
Estimated Time to Re-test: 30 minutes
