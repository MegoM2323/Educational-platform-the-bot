    - 27 related test objects (lessons, messages, assignments)
  Verification:
    - Login as test_teacher@example.com
    - Check admin panel shows 6 users
    - Verify schedule shows 5 lessons

STEP 2: Re-run All Smoke Tests
  Method: Playwright MCP automation
  Expected: 8/8 passing
  Duration: 3-5 minutes
  Location: Use Playwright MCP browser tools
