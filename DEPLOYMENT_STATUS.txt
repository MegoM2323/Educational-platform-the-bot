SUMMARY:
========
Total Tasks: 16
Passed: 4
Partial: 3
Blocked: 1
Pending: 8

SUCCESS RATE: 37.5% (6/16 completed)

CRITICAL BLOCKER:
=================
Docker daemon is not running and cannot be started 
without sudo/password authentication. This blocks 
all containerized deployment tasks.

WORKAROUND:
===========
On system with Docker access:
  1. sudo systemctl start docker
  2. ./scripts/deployment/universal-deploy.sh --verbose
  3. ./scripts/deployment/verify-deployment.sh

FILES CREATED:
==============
- scripts/deployment/deployment-utils.sh
- scripts/deployment/.deploy.env
- deployment-summary.md (comprehensive report)
- 5 new Django migration files
- Test admin user in database

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Start Docker daemon (requires admin)
2. Run universal deployment script
3. Execute verify-deployment script
4. Test all dashboards
5. Deploy to production
