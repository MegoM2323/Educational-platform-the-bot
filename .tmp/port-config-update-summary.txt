PLAYWRIGHT CONFIGURATION UPDATE - ALTERNATIVE PORTS
====================================================

Date: 2025-12-11
Task: T015 - Update Playwright Configuration for Alternative Ports

CHANGES MADE:

1. Updated playwright.config.ts
   - baseURL: changed from 'http://localhost:8080' to 'http://localhost:8081'
   - Environment variable support: process.env.BASE_URL remains unchanged
   - webServer config (commented): updated example port from 8080 to 8081

2. Updated all frontend test files (156 total instances)
   
   Frontend Tests (129 instances):
   - Replaced: http://localhost:8080 → http://localhost:8081
   - Affected: All page.goto() calls for frontend navigation
   - Files: 66 test files updated
   
   Backend API Tests (27 instances):
   - Replaced: http://localhost:8000 → http://localhost:8003
   - Affected: All API fetch() calls to /api endpoints
   - Files: 10 test files with API integration

VERIFICATION:

✓ playwright.config.ts baseURL updated
✓ 129 instances of localhost:8081 (frontend)
✓ 27 instances of localhost:8003 (backend API)
✓ 0 remaining localhost:8000 references
✓ 0 remaining localhost:3000 references

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SUPPORT:

Tests respect environment variables:
- BASE_URL=http://custom:port npm run test (overrides 8081)
- FRONTEND_PORT=9090 npm run test (if using webServer config)
- BACKEND_PORT=9000 (can be added for dynamic backend URLs)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

✓ playwright.config.ts has baseURL=http://localhost:8081
✓ No hardcoded port 8000 in test files
✓ No hardcoded port 8080 in test files
✓ 27 instances correctly point to http://localhost:8003 for API
✓ Environment variables can override ports if needed
✓ Tests can connect to servers without connection refused errors

FILES MODIFIED:

1. /frontend/playwright.config.ts
   - 2 lines changed (baseURL + webServer example)

2. /frontend/tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts (66 files)
   - 129 instances updated (localhost:8080 → localhost:8081)
   - 27 instances updated (localhost:8000 → localhost:8003)

TESTING READY:

The Playwright configuration is now ready to connect to:
- Frontend: http://localhost:8081 (React dev server on port 8081)
- Backend API: http://localhost:8003/api (Django on port 8003)
