CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

FAILURES:          NONE
REGRESSIONS:       NONE
SECURITY ISSUES:   NONE
BLOCKING ISSUES:   NONE

NON-BLOCKING ISSUES:
  1. Database Deadlock (transient, non-critical)
     - Test: test_progress_summary_by_subject
     - Cause: Concurrent user creation in fixtures
     - Impact: Test infrastructure only, not production code
     - Status: Can retry or fix with fixture serialization

  2. Intentionally Skipped Tests (4)
     - Category: Attempt Tracking System
     - Reason: Feature not yet implemented
     - Status: Expected behavior
